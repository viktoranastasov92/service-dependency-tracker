# Service Dependency Tracker

A tool for on-call engineers to register microservices, define dependency edges between them, and query the full upstream/downstream chain of any service to assess blast radius during incidents.

## Implementation Note

This project was implemented entirely using [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) with the **Claude Sonnet** model. The prompts used throughout the implementation are recorded in [PROMPTS-HISTORY.md](PROMPTS-HISTORY.md) — new joiners can read through them to understand the sequence of steps taken to build the project from scratch.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Backend | Java 17, Spring Boot 4.0.6, Spring Data Neo4j |
| Graph DB | Neo4j 5 |
| API spec | OpenAPI 3.1 (API-first, openapi-generator) |
| Frontend | React 18, TypeScript, Vite 5 |
| Graph UI | React Flow 11 + Dagre layout |
| Build | Maven Wrapper + frontend-maven-plugin |
| Tests | JUnit 5, Mockito, Testcontainers |

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Version | Required for |
|------|---------|-------------|
| Docker + Docker Compose | any recent | Running Neo4j; Tier 3 tests |
| Java 17 | exactly 17 | Building and running the backend |
| Node.js 20 | ≥ 20 | Frontend dev server (Maven downloads it automatically for `mvn package`) |

---

## IDE Setup (after a fresh checkout)

The OpenAPI generator runs during the Maven build and writes controller interfaces and DTO classes to `target/generated-sources/`. Run this once so the IDE can resolve them:

```bash
./mvnw generate-sources -Dskip.frontend.build=true
```

In IntelliJ IDEA, right-click `target/generated-sources/openapi/src/main/java` → **Mark Directory as → Generated Sources Root**.

---

## Quick Start — Docker Compose

The simplest way to run the full stack. Builds the JAR (including the frontend) and starts both Neo4j and the application.

```bash
# Build the JAR (downloads Node 20 automatically, runs npm build)
./mvnw package -DskipTests

# Start Neo4j + application
docker compose up
```

Open **http://localhost:8080/api/v1/** in a browser.  
Swagger UI is at **http://localhost:8080/api/v1/swagger-ui.html**.

To stop:

```bash
docker compose down          # keep Neo4j data
docker compose down -v       # also delete the Neo4j data volume
```

---

## Development Setup

Run the frontend and backend separately so you get hot-reload on both sides.

### 1. Start Neo4j

```bash
docker compose up -d neo4j
```

Wait until it is healthy (about 15 seconds):

```bash
docker compose ps neo4j      # Status should show "(healthy)"
```

### 2. Start the Backend

```bash
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dskip.frontend.build=true
```

The API is available at **http://localhost:8080/api/v1/**.

To connect to a Neo4j instance other than the one started by Docker Compose, override these environment variables:

```bash
SPRING_NEO4J_URI=bolt://localhost:7687 \
SPRING_NEO4J_AUTHENTICATION_USERNAME=neo4j \
SPRING_NEO4J_AUTHENTICATION_PASSWORD=trackerpassword \
./mvnw spring-boot:run -Dskip.frontend.build=true
```

### 3. Start the Frontend Dev Server

```bash
cd frontend
npm install          # first time only
npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:5173/** in a browser. All `/api/*` requests are proxied to the Spring Boot backend on port 8080.

---

## Building

### Full build (backend + frontend)

```bash
./mvnw package -DskipTests
```

This:
1. Downloads Node 20.11.0 (first run only, cached in `target/`)
2. Runs `npm install` and `npm run build` inside `frontend/`
3. Copies `frontend/dist/` into `target/classes/static/` so Spring Boot serves it
4. Compiles and packages the JAR

The resulting JAR at `target/service-dependency-tracker-*.jar` is a self-contained artifact that serves both the API and the React SPA.

### Backend only (skip frontend)

```bash
./mvnw package -DskipTests -Dskip.frontend.build=true
```

Useful during backend development to avoid running `npm` on every build.

---

## Running Tests

### Tier 1 — Unit tests (Mockito, no I/O)

```bash
./mvnw test -Dskip.frontend.build=true -Dtest="*ServiceTest,*ControllerTest" -DfailIfNoTests=false
```

### Tier 2 — Controller slice tests (MockMvc standaloneSetup, no Spring context)

These are included in the default `mvn test` run alongside Tier 1.

### Tier 3 — Integration tests (Testcontainers + real Neo4j)

Requires Docker.

```bash
./mvnw test -Dskip.frontend.build=true
```

Testcontainers pulls `neo4j:5` and starts a throwaway container for the duration of the test run. Tests are grouped into:

- `ServiceRepositoryTest` — Cypher query correctness against Neo4j
- `ServiceDependencyTrackerIT` — full Spring context end-to-end through the HTTP layer

### All tests with coverage report

```bash
./mvnw verify -Dskip.frontend.build=true
```

---

## API Reference

The hand-authored OpenAPI spec lives at `src/main/resources/openapi/api.yaml`.

When the application is running, Swagger UI is available at:

```
http://localhost:8080/api/v1/swagger-ui.html
```

### Key endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `POST` | `/api/v1/services` | Register a new service |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/services` | List all services |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/services/{name}` | Delete a service and all its edges |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/services/{name}/dependencies` | Add a dependency edge |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/services/{name}/dependencies` | List direct dependencies |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/services/{name}/dependencies/{depName}` | Remove a dependency edge |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/services/{name}/downstream` | Full downstream chain + cycle report |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/services/{name}/upstream` | Full upstream chain (blast radius) |

Service names must match `^[a-z0-9-]+$` (kebab-case, max 100 characters).

### Dependency types

`RUNTIME` (default) · `BUILD` · `OPTIONAL`

### Cycles

Cycles are **stored, not rejected**. Adding an edge that creates a cycle returns `201`. Cycles are detected at read time and reported in the `cycles` field of traversal responses as ordered sequences of service names where the last element equals the first.

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `SPRING_NEO4J_URI` | `bolt://localhost:7687` | Neo4j Bolt URI |
| `SPRING_NEO4J_AUTHENTICATION_USERNAME` | `neo4j` | Neo4j username |

## Remaining Work

The items below are out of scope for this prototype but required before the system could be considered production-ready.

### Security

- **Authentication & authorisation** — the API is currently open with no authentication. Add Spring Security with OAuth2 / OpenID Connect (e.g. Keycloak, Auth0, or an internal IdP) so that every API request carries a verified identity. Introduce role-based access control: a read-only `viewer` role for on-call engineers querying blast radius, and a `maintainer` role for registering or deleting services and dependency edges.
- **TLS / HTTPS** — traffic between the browser and the server and between the application and Neo4j is currently unencrypted. Terminate TLS at a reverse proxy (nginx, a cloud load balancer) in front of Spring Boot, and enable the Neo4j Bolt+TLS protocol (`bolt+s://`) for the database connection.
- **Swagger UI protection** — the interactive API documentation at `/api/v1/swagger-ui.html` is publicly accessible. In production, restrict it to authenticated users or disable it entirely via `springdoc.swagger-ui.enabled=false` behind an environment flag.
- **Rate limiting** — the API has no rate limiting. A malicious or misconfigured client could flood the traversal endpoints with deep queries. Add a rate-limiting filter (Spring Cloud Gateway, Bucket4j, or a reverse-proxy policy) and cap individual request depth via the `tracker.traversal.max-depth` property.
- **Secrets management** — Neo4j credentials are currently passed as plain-text environment variables. In a production deployment, source secrets from a dedicated secrets manager (HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Kubernetes Secrets with encryption at rest) and rotate them on a schedule.
- **Audit logging** — there is no record of who registered, modified, or deleted a service or dependency edge. Add a structured audit log (who, what, when, from which IP) written to a separate append-only sink so changes can be reviewed after an incident.
- **Input sanitisation hardening** — service names are validated against `^[a-z0-9-]+$`. Review all other free-text inputs (description field) for maximum length enforcement and ensure they are never interpolated into Cypher outside of parameterised queries.

### Observability

- **Metrics** — add Spring Boot Actuator and Micrometer with a Prometheus scrape endpoint (`/actuator/prometheus`). Expose custom metrics: traversal query duration, cycle detection count, number of registered services, and dependency edge count.
- **Distributed tracing** — integrate OpenTelemetry (Micrometer Tracing + an OTLP exporter) to produce trace spans for each API request, including the Neo4j Cypher execution time. Export to Jaeger, Zipkin, or a cloud APM (Datadog, Honeycomb).
- **Structured logging** — switch from plain-text log lines to structured JSON (Logback with `logstash-logback-encoder`) so logs are parseable by log aggregation tools (ELK stack, Loki, CloudWatch Logs Insights).
- **Health checks** — expose a detailed `/actuator/health` endpoint that includes Neo4j connectivity status, and wire it into the Docker Compose `healthcheck` for the application container (currently only Neo4j has one).

### API & Data Model

- **Service update endpoint** — there is no `PATCH /services/{name}` endpoint to update a service's description after registration. Add one.
- **Pagination on `GET /services`** — the list-all endpoint returns every service in one response. Add cursor- or page-based pagination before the service registry grows large.
- **Per-request depth override** — the traversal depth cap (`tracker.traversal.max-depth`) is a server-wide setting. Expose an optional `?maxDepth=N` query parameter on the downstream and upstream endpoints so callers can request a shallower traversal for low-latency use cases.
- **Bulk import endpoint** — provide a `POST /import` endpoint that accepts a JSON graph (services + edges) and loads it transactionally, for migrating an existing registry or seeding from a configuration file.
- **API versioning strategy** — the current `/api/v1/` prefix reserves the option for a `v2` but there is no documented strategy for introducing breaking changes. Define a deprecation and migration policy before the first external consumer is onboarded.

### Testing

- **Frontend unit & component tests** — there are no automated tests for the React application. Add Vitest + React Testing Library for component logic and API client tests.
- **End-to-end browser tests** — add Playwright or Cypress tests that drive the full UI against a running backend to catch regressions in the graph visualisation and form interactions.
- **Performance tests** — verify traversal query performance at realistic graph sizes (1 000+ services, 5 000+ edges) with a load test (k6, Gatling) targeting the downstream and upstream endpoints.
- **Security scanning** — integrate OWASP Dependency-Check into the Maven build to surface known CVEs in third-party dependencies. Add a SAST scan (SpotBugs, Semgrep) to the CI pipeline.

### CI / CD

- **CI pipeline** — there is no continuous integration pipeline. Add a GitHub Actions (or equivalent) workflow that runs on every pull request: compile, run all three test tiers (Testcontainers requires a Docker daemon in the runner), and report coverage.
- **Container image publishing** — the Dockerfile is present but no pipeline publishes images to a container registry. Add a CD step that builds, tags, and pushes the image on merge to main.
- **Infrastructure as code** — the Docker Compose file is suitable for local development only. For a real deployment, define the infrastructure (Kubernetes manifests, Helm chart, or a cloud-provider IaC template) so environments are reproducible and version-controlled.

### Neo4j Production Concerns

- **Neo4j authentication** — the Docker Compose configuration uses `NEO4J_AUTH: neo4j/trackerpassword`. Production instances must use a strong, rotated password sourced from a secrets manager.
- **Backup & recovery** — there is no backup strategy for the Neo4j data volume. Define a backup schedule (Neo4j's `neo4j-admin dump` or a cloud snapshot) and test the restore procedure.
- **Neo4j clustering / high availability** — the current setup is a single Neo4j instance with no replication. For a production deployment that must survive node failures, use Neo4j's Causal Cluster or Aura Enterprise.
- **Database schema constraints** — the Neo4j schema relies on application-level uniqueness enforcement (duplicate service name → 409 from the service layer). Add a native Neo4j uniqueness constraint (`CREATE CONSTRAINT FOR (s:Service) REQUIRE s.name IS UNIQUE`) so the guarantee holds even if the database is written to directly outside the application.
